Problem Statement:
A database project for Exam Section Database Management and faculty allotment program. This Program will help students to show their seat number and their arrangement also will help the faculty to find there appropriate Hall for invigilation.
The purpose of Exam Section Database Management System is to automate the existing manual system by help of web based application solution, fulfilling their requirements, so that valuable data can be stored for a longer period of time with easy accessing and manipulation. 


## Problem Discussion 
Existing system is very slow and inefficient. Hall Allocation is also not an easy task. There is a lot of manual work involved in current system and mistake in one detail can lead to wrong generation of Order Copies and conflict between two allocated faculties. No proper collection of requirements leads a huge problem for this system. This system is to enhance manual work and also more energy is wasted to allocate the seating arrangement.

## Disadvantages of existing system
Current system is manual so all the records are maintained manually. So the seating arrangement of students cannot be determined if updating is not done.
    • Time Consuming 
    •  More manual Work Required
    • Less Accurate
